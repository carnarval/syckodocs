## Story and Narrative

### Briefing

Once there were peace in the city that is now called Sycko City. Once people had the right to
come and go. Once democracy wasn't just a word. But then people manipulated by powerful people
started to hate the state and it's democratic state of law in a propaganda that said "The government is communist,

something that could really "purge" this "evil" government, and then one day the military forces took the power state 
and installed a authoritative government.
