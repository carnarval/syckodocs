## Story and Narrative

### Briefing

Once there were peace in the city that is now called Sycko City. Once people had the right to
come and go. Once democracy wasn't just a word. But then wealthy people manipulated by powerful people
started to hate the state and it's democratic state of law in a propaganda that said "The government is communist, 
we must purge 'em from this earth!". With time this hate became more and more stronger and people wanted
something that could really "purge" this "evil" government, and then one day the military forces took the power state 
and installed a authoritative government.     
     
Sycko City started to become "the" Sycko City is this time. The Capital government wasn't handling the people
needs and security was also not ensured, and with that gangs became to grow and people became to fight
against each other. At this time the government started to build a big wall around all this mess,
the mess that they created, and it was a truly social segregation. They even created a task force, called The Capital Patrol,
to ensure that the poorest stay inside the walls limits and the richest outside of it. When the wall was built they
completely forgot of those inside, even their own task force.

With the wall built some of the gangs got together creating alliances to survive in this big 
concentration camp. In the beginning there were a lot of alliances but 
after thirty years just four of them perished, which is: The Orphans; The Indies; 
The Old Capital Patrol; and The Syndicate. All those fight for Sycko City Unification dreaming of one day to
destroy the wall.

### Alliances
1. **The Orphans**   
   During the wall building the Capital started a severe birth control and
   in consequence babies started to be sent from the capital to 
   Sycko City. When the firsts babies arrived people didn't know what to do,
   but one guy from a gang called Dark Strife took the babies to take care
   of them. People sensitized by this guy action started to help him and then 
   they created the Orphans alliance.
2. **The Syndicate**
