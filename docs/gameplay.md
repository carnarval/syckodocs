# Gameplay and Mechanics

## Gameplay

### Game Progression

There is two types of progression in the game, one is the 
competitive: the ranking, and the another one is the casual/individual: the level and achievements. 
We will describe this two types below and how the'll affect the gameplay.

#### Ranking
        Worms's task


#### Level & Achievements
##### Level
As many other games level is the basic casual and individual progression.
As you play you gain *experience* and also *level*. As you reach new level
you unlock new items, basically *rollers* and also *weapons*.   
    
This table describe the level and weapons that players can unlock     

| Level  | Weapon  | Roller |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | metal  | is the law  |

### Objectives and Matches.
On Sycko City Early Access the main objective of the player is just
win the matches and advance his level/rank.   
There are two kind of games (*casual* and *ranked*) and two kind of 
matches(*TDM** and *DM**). Those who begin to play the game start playing in
*casual* modes because it's just fun and not so much competitive/serious. As you become more
skilled in the game and also powerful you will start to want more serious games 
with players skilled as you, and for you we offer the *ranked* mode.

### Play Flow
As the gamer begin Sycko City, his first duty is create his own character,
after that he joins the Lobby where he can choose whatever he want to do inside the Sycko
City possibilities: join game matches, learn practicing, customize his character,
buy items (both cosmetic and functional) and also many other things.

## Mechanics

Sycko City mechanics is simple and objective.

### Physics
The game physics is a reproduction of the newtonian on a 3D space, but with more joy.  
The player movement uses the joystick X,Y Axis or the keyboard arrows to move, 
it's a accelerated and inertial movement.    

            We are also studying a possible acceleration and deacceleration button to player's movement.
            
### Interactive Objects
Every object that have a minimal physics applied and that is inside game matches is considered interactive. The main and
fundamental type of objects are the weapons, almost every interactive object is a weapon, like a trash can or a metal bar.
That's also one of the reasons why we call Sycko City a beat 'em up game.    
    
There is also another kind of interactive object that you can get outside of game matches and it's
called Items. There are basically two kind of interactive items: Weapons and Rollers
